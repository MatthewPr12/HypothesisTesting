This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
id = 21
k = c(1:100)
l = c(1:50)

# func to generate a_k for x_k
gen <- function(k){
  return((k*log(k^2*id+pi))%%1)
}
```


```{r}
#generating data
a_k = sapply(k, gen)
a_l = sapply(l+100, gen)
x_k = qnorm(a_k)
y_l = qnorm(a_l)

#plotting data
my_plot <- function(data, title, breaks_num){
  h <- hist(data, breaks=breaks_num, plot=FALSE)
  cuts <- cut(h$breaks, c(-Inf,-.005,Inf))
  plot(h, col=c("red", "black")[cuts], main=title)
}

my_plot(x_k, "x_k", 50)
my_plot(y_l, "y_l", 25)
```
```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
